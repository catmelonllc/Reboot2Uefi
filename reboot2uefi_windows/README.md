# Windows Reboot to UEFI Script

This script reboots a modern Windows PC directly into its UEFI firmware setup screen.

## Compatibility
*   Modern PCs using UEFI firmware (most computers made after 2012).
*   This will **not** work on older PCs with a legacy BIOS.

## How to Use
1.  Right-click the `reboot_uefi.bat` file.
2.  Select **"Run as administrator"**.

The script will start a 15-second countdown and then automatically reboot the computer into the UEFI settings.
